# This CI optionally builds libraries and then builds examples against them.
#
# If a change is detected within `esp-mbedtls-sys/`, a rebuild is triggered and this CI will automatically
# rebuild the libraries using the xtask. Then the tests are executed against the rebuilt libraries.
#
# If no rebuild occurs, the tests are executed against the current libraries.
#
# The libraries are pushed on either of these conditions:
# 1. The PR is labelled with `rebuild-libs`.
#    Then libraries will be forcefully rebuilt and then pushed onto the PR branch.
# 2. The libraries are rebuilt on the main branch.
#    When pushing a PR that would trigger a rebuild, the libraries get automatically
#    pushed to the main branch after successful testing.
