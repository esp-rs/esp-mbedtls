//! This module allows for replacing (hooking) some crypto algorithms in MbedTLS
//! with custom ones.
//!
//! The primary purpose being providing hardware-accelerated equivalents on platforms
//! that support it.
//!
//! NOTE: When hooking for some/all algorithms is enabled, those that remain "un-hooked"
//! by the user will NOT use the software implementations provided by MbedTLS,
//! but rather - RustCrypto based ones!

/// The work area is just a sequence of bytes, which is fixed size and pre-allocated (so to say)
/// by MbedTLS, and hopefully big enough for all types of hooks to be able to emplace their
/// state within it.
///
/// For emplacing the state, this trait provides some helper methods to cast the work area
/// to/from the desired types by following Rust emplacement rules (i.e. proper memory alignment
/// of the emplaced type).
///
/// Typically, mult-stage algorithms (e.g., digests) will use this work area to store their
/// intermediate state between calls (as in, between init/reset/update/finish).
