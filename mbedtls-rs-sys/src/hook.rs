//! This module allows for replacing (hooking) some crypto algorithms and timer/clock
//! functionality in MbedTLS with custom implementations.
//!
//! This enables providing hardware-accelerated crypto or platform-specific time sources
//! on platforms that support it.
//!
//! NOTE: For crypto algorithms specifically, when hooking is enabled, those that remain
//! "un-hooked" by the user will NOT use the software implementations provided by MbedTLS,
//! but rather - RustCrypto based ones!

/// The work area memory type used by MbedTLS algorithms' hooks
pub type WorkAreaMemory = [u8];

/// Trait representing a work area used by MbedTLS algorithms' hooks.
///
/// The work area is just a sequence of bytes, which is fixed size and pre-allocated (so to say)
/// by MbedTLS, and hopefully big enough for all types of hooks to be able to emplace their
/// state within it.
///
/// For emplacing the state, this trait provides some helper methods to cast the work area
/// to/from the desired types by following Rust emplacement rules (i.e. proper memory alignment
/// of the emplaced type).
///
/// Typically, mult-stage algorithms (e.g., digests) will use this work area to store their
/// intermediate state between calls (as in, between init/reset/update/finish).
///
/// # Context alignment: why `aligned(16)` on the C struct AND runtime alignment here
///
/// The emplaced state's offset within the work area is computed *at runtime* from the work
/// area's address (see [`WorkArea::cast_mut_maybe`]). Two storage worlds have to coexist:
///
/// - **Compiler-managed storage relocates contexts.** A context that lives in a Rust local,
///   a `Box`, or as a field of a moved struct (e.g. `mbedtls_entropy_context` embeds a SHA
///   context) is relocated by plain bitwise copies that no hook observes — **Rust move
///   semantics** most of all, and C struct assignment. Such a copy is only safe if the new
///   location has the same alignment (mod 16) as the old one, so that the stored state sits
///   at the same offset. This is what the `aligned(16)` attribute on the C structs (see
///   `gen/hook/*_alt.h`) guarantees: every compiler-chosen location is uniformly 16-aligned,
///   the runtime offset is always the same (zero), and bitwise relocation is safe.
///
/// - **Opaque external storage under-aligns contexts — but never moves them.** OpenThread
///   casts its contexts out of `OT_DEFINE_ALIGNED_VAR(..., uint64_t)` byte arrays (8-aligned),
///   and some heaps return 4-aligned memory. There the runtime offset is nonzero but *stable*
///   (heap allocations and OT's in-place storage do not relocate), so runtime alignment makes
///   them work — provided the hooks never create a `&`/`&mut` to the whole context struct,
///   which would assert the declared 16-byte alignment and be instant UB. Hook entry points
///   therefore use raw field projection only — see [`RawWorkArea`]. The `*_WORK_AREA_SIZE`
///   values include slack for the worst-case emplacement offset (see `Hook::work_area_size`
///   in `gen/builder.rs`).
///
/// Duplication through the module clone APIs (`mbedtls_shaX_clone`) is implemented as a
/// *typed* clone (read at the source's offset, re-emplace at the destination's), so it is
/// correct even between differently-aligned locations.
