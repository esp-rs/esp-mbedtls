//! Pure routing decision for ESP modular-exponentiation: pick the hardware
//! operand size for a given limb count, or fall back to software.
//!
//! This is intentionally free of any `esp_hal` dependency so it can be unit
//! tested on the host: under the internal `_route-test` feature the enclosing
//! [`esp`](super) module is mounted even without `esp-hal`, with everything
//! except this submodule compiled out (every other item there is gated on the
//! `esp-hal` feature). The production ESP backend in [`super::exp_mod`] calls
//! [`Route::route_for`] to decide whether a request can be served by the RSA
//! peripheral or must use the MbedTLS software path.
